# Project title: MD_Machine_Learning

This repository is for the graduation projrct for the Master in Data Science 
for Life Sciences at Hanze University of Applied Sciences.

The purpose of this project would be to explore new methods for overcoming both problems by using ideas from machine learning (ML). 
The objective is to explore ML/AI models to predict the effect of mutations on EGFR as obtained from much shorter simulations,
cutting down both time and produced data. Questions that would be answer are: 
    1. Is it possible to predict long term simulations from sort term ones? 
    2. How short is short enough?
